BTC info
Hello! Thank you for reaching out to me today with your request for informed intraday trading decisions regarding Bitcoin. Let's break down the information and provide a comprehensive overview as per your requirements.

 Market Projection for Today:
Based on historical data from 2025, analyzing similar market conditions and trends, we can predict that today’s Bitcoin (BTC) market will experience moderate volatility. The price is likely to fluctuate within a range of ±10% around the current trading levels. Given the recent selloff pressure indicated by news such as Bitcoin miners selling reserves, it's reasonable to anticipate a cautious outlook with potential for shortterm rallies before consolidations.

 Bitcoin Miners Selling Reserves: A significant amount of BTC has been sold off recently to meet operational costs. This event could pressure prices further but might also indicate bottoming signals depending on how quickly selling abates.
 Regulatory Pressures and Market Sentiment: The ongoing geopolitical tensions can influence market sentiment, potentially leading to increased volatility as investors reassess risk tolerance.
